      <question>
      <p>
        A molecular structure problem lets the user use the JSME editor
        component to draw a new molecule or update an existing drawing and then
        submit their work.  Answers are specified as SMILES strings.

        I was trying to draw my favorite molecule, caffeine. Unfortunately,
        I'm not a very good biochemist. Can you correct my molecule?

            <!-- 
               You can set initial state of the editor by including a molfile
               inside of the jsme tag. 
               
               Take care that indentation is preserved.  The molfile format is
               sensitive to whitespace, so the best policy is to cut and paste
               as-is on a new line without adjusting the indentation.  If you
               do indent the molfile data, make sure every line is indented the
               same amount using space characters only, no tabs.

          <p>Explanation</p>
          <p>
            Some scholars have hypothesized that the renaissance was made
            possible by the introduction of coffee to Italy.  Likewise scholars
            have linked the Enlightenment with the rise of coffee houses in
            England.
